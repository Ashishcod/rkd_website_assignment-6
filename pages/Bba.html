    <h1>Objective of the Course:</h1>
To more precise, economy, culture, technology, business, customer preferences, regulations, etc. have become so dynamic that we find it difficult to cope up with them. The doctrine of management which earlier was confined to the functional areas of Production, Finance, Marketing and Human Resource has outstretched its boundaries to cover management of technology, information and Services with the full use of electronics and computing.
Professional education too has become more of learning rather than teaching. Role of a teacher is becoming that of a guide, supporter and an educator. Competition has entered into every sphere of life and for success, no alternative is left apart from sincere and dedicated hard work in the right direction.
